# Tetris in Terminal

This is a tetris game i made in python that uses the text on terminal as its display.
It is currently a work in progress and is still lacking a lot of features a tetris
game would have. I created this because I couldn't find a good enough tetris game
online that I can play at school. This is currently just a bit of practice in creating
a tetris game before moving onto doing the same in a game engine like Pygame or Unity.
This is because playing a game in terminal is just not practical as text printing is
too slow and I am too lazy to learn how to output text faster.

To run the game, just ask python to run it in a terminal or smth
and hope that your pc can print text fast enough. You will have to change the
controls because they are currently to my settings. Soon in the future I will make a
configuration file to make it easy to change settings.
